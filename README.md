# Context
Alexa Internet ranks websites primarily on tracking a sample set of Internet trafficâ€”users of its toolbar for the Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome web browsers. The Alexa Toolbar includes a popup blocker (which stops unwanted ads), a search box, links to Amazon.com and the Alexa homepage, and the Alexa ranking of the website that the user is visiting. It also allows the user to rate the website and view links to external, relevant websites. Also, Alexa has prepared a list of information for each site for comparison and ranking with other similar sites for each site.

This dataset is a record of all information on the top websites in each category in Alexa ranking.

# Content
The dataset includes several site data, which were achieved from "alexa.com/siteinfo" (for example alexa.com/siteinfo/facebook.com). Data is included for the top 50 websites for every 550 categories in Alexa ranking. (The dataset was obtained for about 12200 sites.)
The data also includes keyword opportunities breakdown fields, which vary between categories. As well as each site has important parameters like alltopicstopkeywordssearchtrafficparameter which represent search traffics in competitor websites to this site.
For more details about each site's data, you can find the site's name and site's information in the dataset and you can search alexa.com/siteinfo/SiteName link to understand each parameter and columns in the dataset.
